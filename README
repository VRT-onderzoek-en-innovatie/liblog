This is very much inspired by liblogger (http://liblogger.sourceforge.net/).

It provides a set of Log() macro's that behave similar to printf():
LogTrace(fmt, ...)
LogDebug(fmt, ...)
LogInfo (fmt, ...)
LogWarn (fmt, ...)
LogError(fmt, ...)
LogFatal(fmt, ...)

A first filter is done at compile-time. Log() statements of a level lower than
LOG_LEVEL are removed and produce no code at all.

A second filter is done at run-time. The remaining Log() statements incure a
function call, which returns immediately if the level of the statement is lower
than the current_log_level (set via the LogSetLevel() call).

Output is by default to STDOUT, but can be changed with LogSetOutput(FILE*).

All Log() output is prepended with the current date&time, the location of the
calling statement "file:linenumber (function)". A newline is automatically
appended.
